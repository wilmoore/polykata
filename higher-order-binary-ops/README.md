# Higher Order Binary Operations

Filter a list by applying a generated comparison operatation (function). Multiple languages and paradigms are represented to reveal whatever you are looking to reveal :).

This originally [started as a gist](https://gist.github.com/wilmoore/5559376).

## Languages Represented

- [Scala](#file-less-than-100-scala)
  - **PRO**: First class currying and concise syntax.
  - **CON**: JVM...no thanks.

- [Clojure](#file-less-than-100-clj)
  - **PRO**: Impressive...concise syntax; very clean for a paren-happy language. 
  - **CON**: JVM...no thanks.

- [Groovy](#file-less-than-100-groovy)
  - **PRO**: Ruby on the JVM...cute!
  - **CON**: JVM...no thanks.

- [Ruby](#file-less-than-100-rb)
  - **PRO**: The most beautiful language ever + Enumerable standard library module.
  - **CON**: Slow VM, non-trivial install (just use RVM is not a good answer IMHO), the gems system needs help (bundler makes life better, but it's no panacea).

- [Python](#file-less-than-100-py)
  - **PRO**: Pretty little language, everything is explicit, list comprehensions, kitchen sink standard library.
  - **CON**: Kitchen sink standard library, may be slower than Ruby...that's actually a pretty impressive feat.

- [PHP](#file-less-than-100-php)
  - **PRO**: It's everywhere...like mcdonalds.
  - **CON**: It's everywhere...like mcdonalds, lacks expressiveness, rediculous configuration system, the PEAR packaging system is horrible and composer still doesn't have enough mindshare.

- [Elixir](#file-less-than-100-ex)
  - **PRO**: Ruby-like syntax on top of the Erlang VM. Whoa...where have you been all my life?
  - **CON**: Too new to tell...

- [Go](#file-less-than-100-go)
  - **PRO**: Cross-compile to other architectures.
  - **CON**: I must be doing it wrong because there is no way the language is this fugly (yup, fugly).

- [Dart](#file-less-than-100-dart)
  - **PRO**: Extremely intuitive and fairly concise.
  - **CON**: Too new to tell...

- [LiveScript](#file-less-than-100-op-ls) ([curried](#file-less-than-100-ls))
  - **PRO**: This is what I thought CoffeeScript was going to be + hints of Scala.
  - **CON**: None that I can see so far. I'd caution that the functional bias of the language may seem daunting to some.

- [CoffeeScript](#file-less-than-100-coffee)
  - **PRO**: JavaScript a little lipstick.
  - **CON**: Cute; however, doesn't provide _enough_ value over raw JavaScript to warrent the overhead.

- [JavaScript](#file-less-than-100-js)
  - **PRO**: JavaScript is very expressive and quite fast these days. NodeJS and modern browsers make JavaScript fun.
  - **CON**: Lots of gotchas in the language and in the browser.
